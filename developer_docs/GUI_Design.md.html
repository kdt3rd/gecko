**Gecko GUI Design**

The GUI system attempts to learn from the success of Qt and gtk, yet
retain the simplicity of things like fltk. Further, there are no
license restrictions to worry about with gecko.

Rather than derive a GUI "window" from the actual operating
abstraction of a window, the gecko GUI library is based on containment
of a platform abstraction, and the platform abstraction provides a
window to a gui window. This is done to enable a more flexible
arrangement of the gui infrastructure. For example, one could imagine
a professional monitor setup where some on-screen are desired to be
built, but a normal operating system window running the main UI. This
should lower the overall code requirements to build such a setup.

There are a few main components to building out the user interface
libraries. First, everything will leverage various classes in base, as
is to be expected. Next, there is `platform` and `script`. `script` is
kepts separate from platform, even though it has a cross-platform
component to it, however it is envisioned that other, non-GUI,
routines will want to use it for rendering text, such as compositing
slates in a visual effects pipeline. However, `platform` holds the
majority of classes abstracting platform-specific API from the rest of
the system, whether that be Xlib/xcb, wayland, Cocoa, MS Windows, or
whatever platform arises in the future. 

The `platform` layer is currently expected to create an OpenGL
context, however, that is only a convenience, and is meant to be
hidden largely by the `draw` library. Eventually, this may be
refactored into a general rendering engine, such that running
applications over the network work more transparently without having
to use VNC or whatever. Anyway, the `draw` library is currently
tightly coupled with the `gl` library, which is there to manage OpenGL
concepts, and to provide dynamic discovery of OpenGL functions based
on extensions present, tetc.

Finally, this brings us to the `gui` library. This is the heart of
user interface elements, buttons, line edit widgets, scroll bars,
etc. This also has the "application" layer that is meant to act as the
global arbiter of information and actions across multiple windows.

Platform
========

The `platform` library is meant to abstract away the rest of the code
base from the operating system specific nature of user interface
presentation.

Concepts that need to be thought about:
- receiving events and transforming them to a generic representation
  * mouse events
  * keyboard input (transforming it to UTF-8 as appropriate, as well
    as the raw keyboard for non-text entry event handling)
  * windowing events
  * generic USB HID events (tablet, 3-D space ball, color panels,
    etc.), with a plugin api as necessary
  * generic user-defined events, dispatched and delivered across UI
    elements using the central event dispatch (NB: must be thread safe!)
- creating windows
  * normal windows
  * popup / transient windows (menus, tooltips, notifications)
  * dialog windows
  * embedded UI areas for external programs
  * fullscreen windows (same as normal windows?)
- accelerators
  * global
  * per window
- task bar / tray objects
- any window manager interaction
- global settings (themes / colors)
- system menus (mostly for OS/X support where there is a top menu)
  except this enables centralized accelerator dispatch
- drag and drop
- cut and paste
- timers
- vertical retrace delay event handling (OpenGL extensions to read up
  on: GLX INTEL swap event, GLX NV delay before swap, GLX SGI swap
  control, GLX EXT swap control) for accurate playback
- query / accessor for drawing / rendering capabilities
- audio capture and output
  
The primary drawing API being used initially is OpenGL. This makes it
easier to provide GLSL shaders for color management in viewers and
such.

However, alternate rendering API should be implemented eventually, to
support remote rendering of interfaces when possible.

## Primary Concepts / Classes ##

GUI
===

The `gui` library represents the actual widgets, and an application
class that eases the global nature of the definition of user
interfaces. By instantiating an application, and pushing it to make
the current one, this avoids having to pass the application all
throughout the functions, only to be used in some deep corner to
retrieve preferences.

The API enables widgets to be created in a natural constructor /
function style manner, creating pointer references to underlying
widgets without having lots of std::make_shared everywhere

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ C++
int main()
{
    using namespace gui;
    application app;
    app.push();

    auto win = app.new_window();

    auto l = label( "Hello World", alignment::LEFT );
	auto c = choices();
	c->add_choice( "Choice 1" );
	c->add_choice( "Choice 2" );
	c->add_choice( "Choice 3" );
	c->when_activated.connect( [&](size_t i) { std::cout << "Chose item " << i << std::endl; } );
    auto box = box( alignment::BOTTOM );
	box->set_padding( 12, 12, 5, 5 );
	box->set_spacing( 8, 2 );
	box->add( l );
	box->add( c );
    win->set_widget( box );
    win->show();

    app.run();
    app.pop();
    return 0;
}
